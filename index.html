						<p aling="left"class="p1">Information Technology is the use of networks, computer software, hardware and telecommunications to transmit, 
							store, manage, process, and create information.
							Technology is continuously evolving and expanding even beyond the planet we live on. Though 
							many may fear robots and AI (Artificial Intelligence) taking over the world, we're still centuries 
							away from seeing that advancement in technology. To give you a small glimpse of how far we 
							have advanced in technology I’ll use an everyday object like the automobile. The first set of cars 
							were steam-powered vehicles, they were built in the 1700’s. By the 1800’s we were introduced 
							to Internal Combustion Engines, most of our vehicles still operate today. Notice I said the most 
							and not all? Well, this is because today we have electric vehicles (EV’s). Not only do these 
							vehicles not require gasoline or diesel fuel like other cars, but some of them are even self-driving. 
							In the world today we use technology for pretty much everything, even simple tasks like 
							washing dishes and cooking. Believe it or not, none of these electronic devices and applications 
							that we rely on today would be able to function without some use from the IT field. Though 
							Information Technology is a very broad field, my team and I would like to take a moment to speak to you 
							about what we think are the three most important aspects of the IT field. Those are Software, Hardware, and Network.
